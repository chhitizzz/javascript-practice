# JavaScript Practice

This repository is dedicated to my JavaScript practice journey. It serves as a personal space for improving my JavaScript skills, exploring different concepts, and mastering JavaScript programming.

## Motivation

The main goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in JavaScript and become proficient in writing efficient and clean JavaScript code. By engaging in regular practice and tackling various programming challenges, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain confidence in my JavaScript programming skills.

## Structure

- Each day, a new directory will be created to represent a programming session (e.g., exercise1, exercise2, etc.). Within each directory, you will find JavaScript files containing the code I wrote during that specific programming session.

## Guidelines

- I will practice JavaScript regularly and challenge myself with different coding exercises and projects.
- Before referring to any external resources or solutions, I will make an earnest effort to solve the problems on my own.
- After completing each exercise or challenge, I will review my code for improvements and seek feedback to enhance my coding style.
- I will explore advanced JavaScript concepts like closures, async/await, functional programming, and more to deepen my understanding of the language.

## Progress Tracking

- I will maintain a log in the `Questions.txt` file, which will contain the exercises completed during my JavaScript practice.
- The log will help me track my progress, set goals, and reflect on the areas I need to focus on for improvement.

## Contributions

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, I welcome suggestions, feedback, and contributions from the community. If you have ideas for new JavaScript exercises, improvements to existing code, or any feedback, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
